## Introduction

The project explores personal music activity, using [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/), a website that builds a detailed profile of each user's musical taste by recording details of the tracks heard by the user and [RateYourMusic](https://www.rateyourmusic.com/) a collaborative music database used to catalog and rate music (and films). The former however has a 'Report' section that does statistically create reports for past week and year but is quite limited. We use the liberty of having the overall archival data of both the websites to have the ability to visualize overall, yearly, monthly, weekly or even daily stats for artists, their albums, ratings per album or even play counts and various other combinations.
